## About
* * *
I wear two hats: software tester and aspiring data scientist.  On the software side, I bring years of experience ensuring software quality through meticulous manual and automated testing. I design test cases, identify bugs, and champion data security - all crucial for delivering reliable software. 

But my passion extends beyond testing.  I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science from Liverpool John Moores University, specializing in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This deep dive into data analysis complements my testing background perfectly. The analytical skills and attention to detail honed through testing are invaluable assets in building and evaluating complex ML models.

Here's where it gets exciting.  My data science education opens doors to automate testing processes – a natural progression that leverages both skillsets.  Furthermore, the field of AI testing is rapidly evolving, and my combined experience positions me for a potential future transition into a role like AI Test Engineer. 

In essence, I'm building a unique bridge between software development and data-driven insights.  This dual expertise positions me as a valuable asset in a world increasingly reliant on both software quality and data-driven decision making.  With my testing experience providing a solid foundation, I'm eager to leverage the power of data science to create innovative solutions for the future.

## SPECIALITIES
* * *
* **Test Design and Planning**: They craft test plans that outline how software will be evaluated, ensuring all functionalities are thoroughly checked. This involves creating test cases, which are essentially simulated user interactions that test specific features.

* **Manual and Automation Testing**: They can perform both manual testing, which involves acting like a user and exploring the software, and automated testing, which uses scripts to execute repetitive tasks.

* **Performance Testing**: Some specialists focus on performance testing, where they assess how the software behaves under load. This helps identify bottlenecks and ensure the software runs smoothly under real-world conditions.

* **Communication and Reporting**:  Test specialists need to communicate effectively with developers and other team members. They document bugs they find and report on the overall quality of the software.

* **Staying Current**: The software landscape is constantly evolving, so these specialists need to stay up-to-date on new testing tools and methodologies.
* **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**: Proficiency in cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

* **Model Development**: Building and implementing machine learning models using algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.

* **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and selecting relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance.

* **Evaluation and Validation**: Understanding different evaluation metrics and techniques for assessing model performance, such as cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.

* **Algorithm Selection**: Knowing when to choose one machine learning algorithm over another based on the problem domain, data characteristics, and desired outcomes.

* **Programming and Tools**: Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R, along with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, etc.

* **Data Visualization**: Communicating insights and results effectively through data visualization techniques using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

### Software Test Specialist at IBM INDIA PVT. LTD, Bangalore
#### June 2022 — Present

  #### Project Name :  **Exec-Comp Transformations** 

  #### Project Details : 
  IBM's own internal project which includes 3 different compensation planning applications for the executive's of the organizarion. 3 applications includes Execeutive compensation planner ,
  Equity Generator and Notes Transformation .
  
  #### Description :

This project aims to develop a software system to streamline and optimize the compensation planning process for your organization. 

**Problem addressed:**

* Manual and time-consuming process of collecting and analyzing employee and market data for compensation decisions.
* Difficulty in ensuring fairness, competitiveness, and alignment with business goals in compensation planning.
* Lack of transparency and clear communication around compensation structures.

**Proposed solution:**

The Compensation Planner System will be a centralized platform for all aspects of compensation planning, including:

* **Employee Data Management:** Store and manage employee information relevant to compensation, including job titles, performance reviews, and salary history.
* **Market Analysis Tools:** Integrate with salary survey data and market research tools to determine competitive pay ranges for different positions.
* **Compensation Modeling:** Allow for simulations and scenario planning to model different compensation strategies and their impact on budget and employee satisfaction.
* **Customizable Pay Structures:** Build and configure different compensation packages with base salary, bonus structures, and benefits options.
* **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate reports on compensation trends, identify pay gaps, and track budget allocation.
* **Workflow and Approval Management:** Define a workflow for compensation reviews and approvals, ensuring transparency and efficient decision-making.

**Benefits:**

* **Increased Efficiency:** Automate data collection and analysis, saving time and resources.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Make informed compensation decisions based on accurate and up-to-date data.
* **Improved Fairness and Competitiveness:** Ensure fair and competitive compensation packages to attract and retain top talent.
* **Transparency and Communication:** Enhance communication and transparency around compensation practices with employees.
* **Strategic Alignment:** Align compensation plans with organizational goals and budget realities.

**Target Users:**

* Human Resources personnel responsible for compensation planning and administration.
* Managers involved in employee performance reviews and compensation recommendations.
* Executives overseeing overall compensation strategy.

**This project description provides a high-level overview.  Additional details can be incorporated based on your specific needs, such as:**

* Integration with existing HR systems
* Security and access controls for sensitive data
* Scalability to accommodate future growth
* 
  #### Role & responsibility :
   * **Test Design & Execution:** Craft test cases covering all executive compensation functionalities - base salary, bonuses, stock options, etc.  They'll consider different roles, contracts, and performance levels to ensure accurate calculations. They'll then manually execute these tests from various user perspectives (HR, managers, executives) to identify usability issues.
* **Bug Reporting & Resolution:** Any bugs encountered during testing are meticulously documented. This includes steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior vs. actual results.  They'll work closely with developers to resolve these defects and ensure timely fixes.
* **Security Champion:** Given the sensitive nature of executive compensation data, the tester becomes a security champion. They'll verify data access controls are properly implemented, restricting access based on user roles and permissions. They'll also test scenarios for potential unauthorized access attempts. 
* **Performance & Usability:**  The tester evaluates system performance under load, simulating real-world usage.  They identify bottlenecks that could impact user experience. Additionally, they focus on the user interface for different user roles, ensuring it's intuitive and facilitates efficient compensation planning tasks.
* **Reporting & Documentation:**  The tester verifies reports generated by the system accurately reflect compensation data and provide valuable insights. They also maintain thorough test documentation, including test plans, test cases, and defect reports. This ensures traceability and future regression testing.
* **Collaboration & Knowledge:**  Clear communication is key. The tester reports on testing progress, identifies roadblocks, and actively participates in discussions to ensure the system meets all requirements. Additionally, gaining a basic understanding of executive compensation practices allows them to design more effective test cases.
