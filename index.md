Fraud detection protects customer and enterprise information, assets, accounts, and transactions through the real-time, near-real-time, or batch analysis of activities by users and other defined entities. Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning allows you to run automated transaction processing on an example dataset or your own dataset. The included ML model detects potentially fraudulent activity and flags that activity for review.
