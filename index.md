<p style="font-size:110%;">Welcome to the portal for communication, news, guidelines, and other information about the <strong>Disease Maps Project</strong>, an open community effort to comprehensively represent disease mechanisms for various diseases.</p>
        
<p>UPCOMING EVENT: The <strong>Disease Maps Community Meeting 2020</strong> (DMCM2020) is scheduled 12-14 November 2020 in Berlin and is organised by the team of Olaf Wolkenhauer, <a href="https://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/team">University of Rostock</a>.</p>
        
### What is a disease map?

<p>A systems medicine disease map is a high-quality expert community-driven representation of disease mechanisms, a conceptual model of a disease. The detailed layer consists of interconnected signalling, metabolic and gene regulatory pathways stored in standard formats such as <a href="http://sbgn.org/" target="_blank">SBGN</a>, <a href="http://sbml.org/" target="_blank">SBML</a> and <a href="http://biopax.org/" target="_blank">BioPAX</a>. The involvement of domain experts (clinicians and biologists) ensures that all the disease hallmarks are covered and relevant knowledge is adequately represented.</p>
        
### What are the disease maps for?  

<p>In translational medicine projects disease maps are used for advanced ‘omics data interpretation and hypothesis generation, as the basis for mathematical models, for predictive analysis and for building clinical decision support systems. The maps can be used for educational purposes as teaching aids.</p>
        
### The community     

<p>The Disease Maps Project is designed as a large-scale community effort. It is a network of groups that work together in order to better understand disease mechanisms. We exchange best practices, share information, develop tools  to make it easier for all the involved groups to achieve their goals.</p>
