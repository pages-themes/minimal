# Market Making RoadMap Overview
Welcome to my Market Making Website 

Market Microstructure? Dynamic Programming? Price Impact Regression? What do all of these obscure, academic sounds phrases have to do with market making and more importantly, what is market making and why should I care?
Truthfully, the complexity of academic literature within the market making space is vast enough for one to do several PhDs in. However, I believe that understanding the core principles and theories of market-making does not require years of academic training - anyone who has an interest in markets can grasp it. 
    
*So why should you care about market making?* 

That being said, learning these principles on your own can be daunting, as I often found myself having no idea where to even start. A quick google of "what is market making" leads to a lot of information, with answers about bid/asks spreads, limit-order books, high frequency trading and more. None of these are wrong, but for me, it was always difficult to synthesize this information in a coherent flow.
Throughout this article series I hope to create a resource that I wish I had several years ago - outlining fundamental concepts in market making while sharing a large body of resources and references that both helped me gain understanding, as well as pointed me in the right direction to explore dddfurther. I hope that this works out!

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
