**Web Design is messy.** Tutorials can be great – but it is not only always the best way to learn.

If you have finished classwork please work on this ongoing assignment.

Create a basic webpage. Include CSS. Create a wrapper in which to contain content. It does not have to be visible.

**Next:** Create div’s that span the width of the wrapper.

In each each div “row” include the following. You can vary the content of each row with the following.

Create a header for each blog and give it a label fitting the content of your div’s.
Add the date of this “post”.

Content: It should vary. Some div’s may only contain text. But many should contain images, images, and text, video etc…. you have total control. But be ambitious!

What kind of media could you include:

- Images
- Youtube Video (embeds)
- Soundcloud content (embeds)
- Vimeo
- and many others

##Codepen.io

If you are feeling very adventurous you can add content from [codepen.io](http://www.codepen.io){target="_blank"}.

This is some **VERY advanced code**. Only utilize it if you feel comfortable. You will need to create a free account to use it. The free account is totally free. It is not a trial.

Have fun. There is no due date set yet.
