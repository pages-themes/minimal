# Glossary

**Entity** (or map entity), a map element that represents, for example, different classes of material entities in PD: metabolite, protein, RNA, gene, multimer or complex. In AF it represents the corresponding activities.  

**Curation** (or pathway curation, or map curation), a process of selecting, organising and integrating information from scientific literature and databases to build a representation of a biological system.  

**Disease map**, a conceptual model of disease mechanisms represented in a standard format as a network that consists of interconnected pathway diagrams relevant to a specific disease.  

**Interaction**, a connection between two or more entities on a diagram. For example, a connection between two proteins. In AF it is represented by one directed edge, and in PD it is represented by a process.  

**Module**, in the context of this review – a comparatively small part of a diagram, a high-quality, self-contained, reusable component that is individually easier to build and update.  

**Modularity**, a desired property of networks towards easier management, reusability, composability and compatibility with similar projects.
Process, a dedicated glyph in the PD language. It has one or several consumption inputs and one or several production outputs, and optionally – regulatory inputs. An example of a process of a metabolic reaction with one or more substrates and one or more products with an enzyme as the regulatory element.  

**Reconstruction**, the process of building a biological network to reflect available knowledge about a biological system.  

**Submap**, the term used within the MINERVA Platform – a separate diagram that is a part of a hierarchically-organised map. Normally, a resource has an entry-point map that leads to the sub-pathways included in the resource.
